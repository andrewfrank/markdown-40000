<h1 id="leviathan-tournament-companion">LEVIATHAN TOURNAMENT
COMPANION</h1>
<p>VERSION 1.0</p>
<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Leviathan Tournament Companion! The following
guidelines are designed to support organisers of Warhammer 40,000 events
in delivering a fine-tuned tournament experience using the <em>Leviathan
Mission Pack</em>. That product offers unprecedented scope for all kinds
of matched play, and its many variables create a dizzying array of
potential missions – thousands, in fact! Some of these are particularly
well suited to the most hotly contested scenarios, and this pack
provides suggestions for the best event configurations. We have also
taken the opportunity to optimise certain Core Rules concepts for
tournament play.</p>
<p>This document provides a ready-made framework for levelling the
playing field and getting games underway quickly, whether you are
planning your first matched play event or have years of experience
organising the largest and most acclaimed tournaments. Its
recommendations will be followed in full at most Games Workshop matched
play events, and are considered the official way to play Warhammer
40,000 in a tournament setting, but can be adapted to suit your own
circumstances – the terrain layout advice is aimed primarily at newer
organisers, for example, and those with large established terrain
collections should feel free to interpret it accordingly.</p>
<p>The recommendations are presented as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leviathan Tournament Mission Sequence:</strong> Adjustments
to the steps players would normally follow to generate a mission and
prepare the battlefield.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Leviathan Card Updates:</strong> Tweaks to certain cards in
the <em>Leviathan Mission Pack</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Leviathan Tournament Mission Pool:</strong> 15 recommended
tournament rounds to draw from, with pre-set Primary Missions, Mission
Rules and deployment modes that put all players on an equal footing and
minimise pre-game admin.</li>
<li><strong>Terrain Layouts:</strong> A suite of carefully designed
terrain setups to be used in conjunction with the Leviathan Tournament
Mission Pool.</li>
<li><strong>Pairings and Rankings:</strong> Advice for fairly pairing
players and determining rankings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leviathan-tournament-mission-sequence">LEVIATHAN TOURNAMENT
MISSION SEQUENCE</h2>
<p>Players should use the mission sequence presented in the
<em>Leviathan Mission Pack</em>, but replace steps 2, 4 and 5 with those
shown below.</p>
<h3 id="determine-mission">2 DETERMINE MISSION</h3>
<p>Instead of shuffling and drawing from the Deployment, Mission Rule
and Primary Mission decks, players should use the pre-generated missions
from the Leviathan Tournament Mission Pool. Set aside the Secondary
Mission and Gambit decks as normal (players will receive these
later).</p>
<h3 id="place-objective-markers">4 PLACE OBJECTIVE MARKERS</h3>
<p>Players now set up objective markers on the battlefield. Each
Deployment card’s deployment map will show players how many objective
markers to set up and where each should be placed. In Leviathan
Tournament Missions, models can end any type of move on top of an
objective marker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> <em>In the Warhammer 40,000 Core
Rules, objective markers are physical artefacts that models cannot end a
move on,representing vital data caches, xenos relics, Chaos portals or
anything else that suits your narrative. While this adds to the
cinematic nature of the battlefield and offers exciting hobby
opportunities, it can sometimes result in model-positioning
circumstances that not everyone will enjoy equally. As such, these
guidelines recommend treating objective markers as flat, circular
markers 40mm in diameter that offer no impediment to the movement or
placement of models.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="create-the-battlefield">5 CREATE THE BATTLEFIELD</h3>
<p>Players now create the battlefield and set up terrain features.
Missions are played on rectangular battlefields whose dimensions are
approximately 44” by 60”.</p>
<p>When setting up terrain features, use the guidelines detailed in the
Terrain Layouts section of this pack. Players must use the rules for
terrain features detailed in the Core Rules. While other approaches to
terrain layout may work within the collections of experienced
organisers, we recommend these terrain guidelines when otherwise in
doubt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> <em>During the Select Secondary Missions
step, if a player decides to use Tactical Missions, note that the two
Secondary Mission cards they place face down and then reveal to their
opponent should be returned to their Secondary Mission deck before they
reshuffle it (they are not placed to one side or discarded). Before
drawing cards in tournament play, it is always good practice to offer
your opponent the opportunity to cut your deck.</em></p>

<h2 id="leviathan-card-updates">LEVIATHAN CARD UPDATES</h2>
<p>When using the <em>Leviathan Mission Pack</em>, use the updated cards
presented on this page in place of their printed equivalents. Note that
both the Attacker and Defender should use the text presented on the
Attacker cards shown below. Updated text is shown in red.</p>

<h2 id="leviathan-tournament-mission-pool">LEVIATHAN TOURNAMENT MISSION
POOL</h2>
<p><strong>The 15 Leviathan Tournament Missions in this section are
designed to act as a pool from which organisers can build their events,
selecting from it in random order. Further commentary on these is given
below.</strong></p>
<h3 id="primary-missions"><em>Primary Missions</em></h3>
<p>Every Primary Mission from the <em>Leviathan Mission Pack</em> is
included in this mission pool. If you are running an event with only 3-6
rounds, we recommend selecting options that span a variety of different
Primary Missions. For example, if running a 3-round Saturday tournament,
you might use missions A, B, and C, or D, F, and G.</p>
<p>For those running longer-format events, or whose attendees are
particularly expectant of a perfectly balanced mission every time, we
have included the more straightforward Primary Missions in a greater
number of configurations.</p>
<h3 id="mission-rules"><em>Mission Rules</em></h3>
<p>Mission Rules are an exciting component of the <em>Leviathan Mission
Pack</em>, providing twists to the way a mission is normally played, and
the ones recommended here are particularly suited to tournament play.
For the Leviathan season of play, we recommend using Chilling Rain
(i.e. no effect), Hidden Supplies, Chosen Battlefield and Scrambler
Fields, as shown in the configurations below.</p>
<h3 id="terrain-layouts"><em>Terrain Layouts</em></h3>
<p>When using the recommended terrain layouts in this pack, please note
the layouts best suited for each deployment mode, as shown in the table
below. We recommend structuring your mission order to facilitate any
changes to terrain layouts you will need to make during your event.</p>

<h2 id="terrain-layouts-1">TERRAIN LAYOUTS</h2>
<p><strong>The following battlefield recommendations are intended
primarily for newer organisers and those looking for a steer in building
up a terrain collection for regular tournament play. These layouts will
be seen at most Games Workshop matched play events, and reflect the type
of terrain density that creates risk-and-reward decisions that a wide
variety of army types can engage with. They are by no means the only way
to set up a battlefield for balanced play, but represent a reliable
starting point when in doubt.</strong></p>
<p>These layouts were designed with a few key principles in mind:</p>
<h3 id="no-fixed-measurements">NO FIXED MEASUREMENTS</h3>
<p>Precisely locked terrain layouts with fixed measurements are not
recommended. As well as limiting the variety of terrain organisers may
feel permitted to field, such strictures can encourage army construction
that plans for guaranteed measurements for the purposes of line of
sight, objective control and so on. Furthermore, it can create
problematic mid-game situations should players notice their terrain does
not meet prescribed limits. When using these layouts, players should
ensure they are as close to the illustrated positions as possible, but
organisers should avoid mandating precise locations for each piece.</p>
<p>In general, however, there should be at least 4” between the physical
edges of each terrain feature. This is primarily to avoid situations
where certain factions (e.g. Imperial Knights) are unable to interact
with areas of the battlefield due to Ruins and other impediments being
too close together.</p>
<h3 id="objective-markers">OBJECTIVE MARKERS</h3>
<p>Objective markers can and sometimes will be either hidden within
terrain or placed in the open, but the markers themselves should never
intersect a wall or similar element.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-ruins">USE OF RUINS</h3>
<p>The following layouts primarily use the Ruins terrain feature. This
efficiently achieves a good amount of line-of-sight blockage and cover
appropriate for balanced games, thanks to the natural abstraction of
line of sight within the rules for Ruins. Remember that a variety of
terrain heights not only adds to the immersive nature of the
battlefield, but is also important for line of sight and rules such as
Plunging Fire. For organisers and players with a more robust terrain
collection (especially elements that block true line of sight),
incorporating features such as Woods, Barricades and Hills into your
chosen layouts is perfectly acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="pairings-and-rankings">PAIRINGS AND RANKINGS</h2>
<p>There are countless different ways in which a Warhammer organised
play event can be run. While broad-stroke concepts like pairing off
players with the same record are straightforward enough, the nuance of
running a successful Warhammer tournament is the subject of continuous
conversation and evolution. The following recommendations are once again
for newer organisers who are still establishing their principles and
best practices, to help improve the average experience at any Warhammer
tournament. These principles are also followed at most official Games
Workshop events, and are designed to create the fairest, most fun
experience possible for every attendee, regardless of standing.</p>
<h3 id="pairing-players">PAIRING PLAYERS</h3>
<p>While the first round of most tournaments is randomly paired,
subsequent round pairing can be done in a number of ways. The first
pairing metric will almost always be player record, i.e. pairing a 3-1
player with another 3-1 player, and so on. Given that most rounds will
include numerous players with the same record, however, deciding
pairings beyond this metric can be quite nuanced, and the different
methods available can have significant impacts on the experience of
players at an event. We recommend pairing players by the following
criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First</strong> - by record (i.e. the number of wins, losses
and draws)</li>
<li><strong>Second</strong> - by win path (i.e. the timing of the rounds
in which a player won or lost their games)</li>
<li><strong>Third</strong> - randomly within players of the same
ranking</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="win-path"><em>Win Path</em></h4>
<p>A player’s ‘win path’ refers not to their number of wins and losses,
but to the timing of those wins and losses. While pairing by win path
has an incidental tendency to pair people by strength of schedule, its
greatest impact is on the overall enjoyment experienced by all players,
as it tends to pair players based upon shared experience.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take two 3-1 players. One of them lost their first
game; they likely lowered their expectations for winning the whole event
after this, but are probably in a great mood after three consecutive
victories. The other won their first three games then lost their fourth
– a sharp disappointment after a 3-0 start. Should these players face
off, their shared enjoyment may be at odds as they are in very different
emotional places. Win path ensures players enter their match with recent
common experiences upon which to build a friendship during their next
game of Warhammer.</p>
<h3 id="ranking-players">RANKING PLAYERS</h3>
<p>In many tournaments, the overall Best General will be the single
remaining undefeated player at the end of the event. Sometimes, however,
there are not enough rounds available to determine a single undefeated
player, and players often wish to know their ranking regardless of
whether they won the whole event. To help break ties between players who
end an event with the same record, we recommend ranking players by the
following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First</strong> - by overall record (wins, losses and
draws)</li>
<li><strong>Second</strong> - by their opponents’ win records
(i.e. those with more wins against opponents with better win records
would place higher)</li>
<li><strong>Third</strong> - by total Victory points (VP)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> <em>Traditionally, many organisers
use total VP or VP differential to determine ranking. However, the
number of VP scored within any one game of Warhammer 40,000 rarely tells
a clear story about how close that game actually was. Often, a more
challenging opponent will be harder to score against (and thus yield a
lower score despite the victory being all the more hard-earned), or the
nature of how the two armies match up may dictate a risky strategy that
doesn’t pay off (and thus yield a wide score disparity despite almost
working out).</em></p>
<p><em>As such, we do not recommend using VP as a pairing metric, nor as
a ranking metric until all other metrics have been exhausted, or when
further tie-breaking is required (e.g. in larger events where identical
rankings become more likely). By contrast, opponent win record is an
ideal metric, because when two players end up with the same record, the
overall skill of their opponents is a better indicator of which player
had the more challenging path along the way.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-rules-commentary"><em>The Rules Commentary</em></h4>
<p>There are myriad ways to enjoy the Warhammer hobby, and these all
manifest themselves at a tournament: gifted hobbyists with beautiful
armies, skilled competitors aiming for Best General, casual players
looking to face new opponents and make new friends (by far the most
common type of attendee), and even practitioners of the niche hobby of
Rules Lawyer! These particular hobbyists often find unusual rules
interactions at the very fringes of Warhammer 40,000, which can create
interesting challenges for tournament organisers looking to provide
clear answers and an easy gaming experience for their attendees. For the
current edition, the Warhammer Design Studio has created its most robust
and comprehensive Rules Commentary to date. Available to download on
<em>warhammer-community.com</em>, this living document will be reviewed
periodically to clarify any issues that may be causing uncertainty.
Should an odd rules interaction come up during your event and the Core
Rules do not provide a clear answer, we recommend consulting the Rules
Commentary.</p>

<h2 id="afterword">AFTERWORD</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE POINT OF A WARHAMMER TOURNAMENT?</strong></p>
<p>Warhammer is more popular than ever, and this popularity has extended
to the tournament scene. Over the last few years, more than one million
games of Warhammer 40,000 were played in tournaments around the world,
and that growth will only continue in the future. With so many Warhammer
hobbyists participating in the game within growing communities, it’s
important to ruminate on the point of a tournament. First and foremost,
it is not about celebrating the ultimate victor; someone who goes
undefeated and wins Best General needs very little acclaim beyond the
outcome itself (after all, they won!). Instead, it is the experience of
every single attendee that truly matters, and the recognition that, for
most people who attend a tournament, community and friendship are both
the purpose and the outcome.</p>
<p>Before you roll a single dice against an opponent to start your
tournament experience, remember two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The person across the table from you shares your love of
Warhammer.</li>
<li>By the time the dust settles on the event, almost everyone will have
lost a game (typically, at most, only one or two people will manage to
leave the event without a loss).</li>
</ol>
<p>While any game often yields winners and losers on the tabletop, the
magic of Warhammer in an event setting is the opportunity it provides
every participant to become a bigger part of the Warhammer community,
and to build friendships with fellow hobbyists that can last a lifetime.
As an organiser or a player, if you focus on this inalienable truth,
then while most of you will have lost a game or two, you’ll all share
victory in your experience of what it is to attend a Warhammer
event.</p>
